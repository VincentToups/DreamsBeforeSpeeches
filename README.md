Dreams Before Speeches

_Dreams Before Speeches_ is my National Novel Generating Month entry.
It presents a series of presidential speeches made or rehearsed in
dreams during the presidency of Ronald Reagan.

The novel is generated using a series of modified Markov models
trained on both the collected speeches of the Reagan presidency and
several of the works of Arthur Schopenhauer, the pessimist
philosopher.
